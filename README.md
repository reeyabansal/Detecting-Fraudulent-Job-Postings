# Detecting Fraudulent Job Postings

This project aims to detect fraudulent job postings using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features of job advertisements, we can identify potentially fraudulent listings to protect job seekers from scams and misleading offers.

## Project Overview

Fraudulent job postings pose a significant threat to job seekers, potentially leading to identity theft, financial losses, or other forms of exploitation. This project leverages data analysis and machine learning to automatically flag suspicious job listings, helping to create a safer online job market.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning of job posting datasets
- Feature engineering to extract relevant information from job descriptions
- Implementation of machine learning models for fraud detection
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance
- Visualization of results and insights

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required libraries (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`):
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/reeyabansal/Detecting-Fraudulent-Job-Postings.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Detecting-Fraudulent-Job-Postings
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset of job postings in CSV format
2. Run the data preprocessing script:
   ```
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```
   python train_model.py
   ```
4. Evaluate the model's performance:
